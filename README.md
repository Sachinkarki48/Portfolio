ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sachin Karki, a Front-End Developer with a strong focus on crafting websites and applications that excel in usability and adaptability. Iâ€™m driven by the art of designing visually appealing interfaces that seamlessly integrate with top-notch user experience.

ðŸ’¼ My experience as a Front-End Developer at Snowbirds IT Services has equipped me with the skills to build and maintain a range of web portals and sites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. My expertise in ReactJS, alongside close collaboration with back-end developers, has enabled me to create smooth, web-based solutions. I'm proficient in version control with Git and have conducted rigorous unit testing to ensure high standards of quality.

I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University.

ðŸš€ My technical toolkit encompasses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, SQL, and Bootstrap, among other technologies. Iâ€™m committed to staying at the forefront of technology trends and continually enhancing my skills, whether working independently or as part of a team.
